# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Generation


The Water Quality Generation app is designed to simulate and analyze water quality based on various environmental factors, offering users a comprehensive tool to understand how soil type, weather conditions, and agricultural practices influence water quality levels. Through this app, users can generate synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios, allowing them to explore the relationships between variables such as soil type, sunlight hours, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, humidity, and plant growth milestones.
